My old video posts no longer work after reels were added. Another issue is when I want to remove audio from a reel, it says the audio is removed and when I listen in the draft there is no audio, but when it uploads the original audio is back.

No reels freezing up and stories are loading much faster. It's been much easier to post things and make reels now and to find accounts. Not five stars yet bc I do wish when u make reels there can be an option where you can write how many seconds u want the each picture to be. That would b a game changer. Pls consider it!!!

Just have the buttons anywhere but the left and right sides as those are important screen space that are in every duet trend. However this doesnt mean that the duets themselves should be changed.

Also I didn't read it but i posted a video first thing but it had nude content and i set it to private and that wasn't good enough.. they didnt catch it so a few people saw it which is embarrassing 💀 but... my bad.

There are only a couple things I kind miss from the original app. I know this probably won’t happen but it’s just a suggestion. First of all the original Likee (Likee) had a Featured page and a Following page. At I loved to look at the Featured page even though not much stuff gets Featured anymore it’d be nice to have it. But I’d like to keep the For You because they are both fun to have. Another thing I miss is Crowns. Instead of the Drafts I miss the old Privates. They were just easier to access then the drafts are. Also I miss the leaderboard, it was fun sometimes just to check out the people who were trending that day and see if they have any cool videos.

I am not that old, so I don’t have a job or any way to make money, so I don’t think I can afford premium.

I use it for pictures and videos. And the fact that this app is still free, blows my mind!The app, when editing a video, allows you to trim it just like you want. Sometimes, the frames may be off. But I fix that by splitting the video a lot to get the frames more precise. So if you have any trouble, try any way possible to make it how you like it. likee will most likely have an answer to your problems in the app itself. I feel like you just need to know what you are doing with this app to have well-made pictures or videos. Although, there is one or two problems I have with this app time to time. One being, no matter what you do on the video editing, it may randomly make the video paused and no matter where you scroll or when you press play, it will still stay paused. And that really can mess up my editing because then I will have to draft it. Shortly after I do that, sometimes the draft gets lost or things like that. So, these are the only two problems I have faced so far.This app already had an update where you can add pictures into your videos.

For one, the new photo viewer. You can't zoom in on photos, and if you accidentally swipe upwards, it'll automatically show you photos from another post. Next, Staff has recently stated that they plan on collapsing reblogs on posts, similar to how Twitter does it. This would change how the website functions, and take away a core draw-in for new users.

I think the idea and intention of meetup is great, but the navigation of the app and the searches are poor. Searching for groups or meetups should be easy to navigate between and not so limited to a certain town which needs to be changed per search and should be done by a broader better keyword search. Your main location should be part of your profile to see what's going on near you in a section of the home page, but explore searches should be constantly adjustable within the search with more criteria options such as a drop down menu at the top with keyword search, exploration area, distance from, automatic extended broader search for nearby areas outside of original search, be able to choose - looking for - groups or meetups, etc without having to back out from the search completely to change anything.
